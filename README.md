# AML Project

- put data in '02' as 'Spotify_Dataset_V3.csv'
- setup a python3 virtual environment and install the following packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit learn, seaborn, imblearn, pickle, xgboost, spotipy
- run the individual '.ipynb' type notebooks in '02/src' with 'Data Processing.ipynb' for data processing, 'EDA.ipynb' for exploratory data analysis, 'modelCreation.ipynb' for model setup and evaluting the performance, 'futurePredictions.ipynb' for obtaining model's prediction on unseen examples. 

## Versions of the packages used in the project
python 3.11, pandas 2.0.3, numpy 1.23.5, matplotlib 3.7.2, scikit-learn=1.2.2, seaborn 0.12.2, imbalanced-learn 0.10.1, pickle 0.7.5, xgboost=1.7.3, spotipy=2.23.0
