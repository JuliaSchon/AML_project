abstract="In this chapter, you will discover the kNN model. The kNN model is the third supervised machine learning model that is covered in this book. Like the two previous models, the kNN model is also one of the simpler models. It is also intuitively easy to understand how the model works. As a downside, sometimes it is not performant enough to compete with the more advanced machine learning models that you will see in the following chapters.",
